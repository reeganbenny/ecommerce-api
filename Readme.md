# Introduction

This `mirrAR (ecommerce api)` is for Product Management! This project aims to provide a robust and scalable solution for managing products and their variants in an e-commerce system. Leveraging the power of Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB with Mongoose, our API offers seamless operations for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving products and variants.

# Key Features

- **Product and Variant Management:** Our API allows you to create and manage products, each having multiple variants. A product is defined by its name, description, and price, while a variant includes additional attributes like name, SKU, additional cost, and stock count.

- **Search Functionality:** Seamlessly search products by their names, descriptions, or variant names. Our API ensures quick access to relevant products based on user preferences, enhancing the shopping experience.

- **Test Driven Development (TDD):** To ensure reliability and maintainability, our codebase follows Test Driven Development. Comprehensive tests are written for each model, endpoint, and search functionality, validating the API's behavior.
